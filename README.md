# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting diabetes outcomes based on various health indicators. The project utilizes a well-known diabetes dataset and focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to achieve predictive accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Detailed analysis of the diabetes dataset to understand underlying patterns and characteristics.
- **Data Cleaning**: Includes outlier removal and oversampling to address dataset imbalance, improving model training effectiveness.
- **Feature Engineering**: Conducted label encoding and feature selection to refine the model's input and enhance prediction performance.
- **Model Training**: Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to determine the most effective approach for this dataset.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to apply various machine learning techniques to a real-world problem, enhancing the predictive accuracy and providing insights into the factors that influence diabetes outcomes. This project serves as an educational resource for understanding the steps involved in a typical machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model selection.

Feel free to explore the code, and any contributions or suggestions for improvement are welcome!
